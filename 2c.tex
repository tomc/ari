\chapter[2C]{\cl2}

Our \cl2 opener shows about 10-15 HCP with 6 or more clubs. Good 9s with some extra shape are acceptable as well, especially in 3rd seat. Four-card or even five-card majors are possible as well. In 3rd seat, opening a good five-card club suit is permittable as well.

\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{2c,?}}      
\di2 & Artificial asking bid, promising INV+ \\ % Yes, promises INV+.  Removed \ari comment.
\he2/\sp2 & NF constructive, usually about 7-11 HCP with 5+ in the suit bid \\
