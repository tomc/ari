\chapter[2C]{\cl2}

Our \cl2 opener shows about 10--15 HCP with 6+ \clubsuit. Good 9 HCPs with some extra shape are acceptable as well, especially in 3rd seat. Four-card or even five-card majors are possible as well. In 3rd seat, opening a good five-card club suit is allowed as well for lead direction/preemptive purposes.

\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{2c,?}}
