\chapter{General Rules}

\begin{itemize}[]
\item \textbf{Relays Off} Most relay auctions bail in competition, we don't tend to try to continue to relay when the opponents are interfering.
\item \textbf{Fast arrival} When we are forced to a certain level (say after a cuebid), bidding that level is the weakest action. This is true even over something like a double, where pass is more encouraging than retreating.
\item \textbf{Jumps} Most single jump shifts in comp are fit showing. Most jump raises are weak. Double jumps where available are splinters, but are lower precedence than Fit when only 1 jump available.
\end{itemize}
