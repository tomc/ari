	This part of the document is to record hands and/or discussion which came up at the table for posterity.  I haven't fully decided how I want to organize this.  For the time being at least I am going to put each tournament into its own chapter, with sections for individual hands.  I can then use references in other sections of the document where the item in question came up.
	
	This may also help with crafting a to-do list, if we have items which came up that don't fit anywhere.
