	Random competitive things that have come up at the table, currently unsorted. Eventually we will set up this part of the notes as well, but for now this will do to record things.

	Opp interfered RW into our invitational sequence. There are lots of approaches here that are possible, but we decided to play:
	\begin{description}
		\item[Pass] Non-forcing. Expectation is the 1NT bidder will not reopen unless they have a 5 card suit.
		\item[Dbl] Penalty
		\item[2NT] Mod. Lebensohl: Not a puppet, but instead the 1NT bidder bids their better minor. We may lose out when opener has only clubs, but we will win when they have a 2 suited hand.
		\item[3x] Nat GF
	\end{description}

	\hrule
	
	When the opponents make an artificial raise, if the raise promises invitational values then double is lead directing. If it can be weaker, then double is takeout. The most common example of this is vs. Bergen Raises.
	
	\hrule
	
	After a balancing 1NT, we play wide range (11--16) over a major with size ask Stayman and a narrow range (11--14) over a minor opening. When there is no size ask, systems are \textit{off}: Qbid is Stayman, no transfers. (e.g., this is NF:) \auction{1d,p,p,1nt,p,2c}

	\hrule
	
	After we make a support double, new suits are NF. Jump or Q to force.
