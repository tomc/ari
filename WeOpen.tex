	Opp interfered RW into our invitational sequence. There are lots of approaches here that are possible, but we decided to play:
	\begin{description}
		\item[Pass] Non-forcing. Expectation is the 1NT bidder will not reopen unless they have a 5 card suit.
		\item[Dbl] Penalty
		\item[2NT] Mod. Lebensohl: Not a puppet, but instead the 1NT bidder bids their better minor. We may lose out when opener has only clubs, but we will win when they have a 2 suited hand.
		\item[3x] Nat GF
	\end{description}

	\hrule

After we make a support double, new suits are NF. Jump or Q to force.
