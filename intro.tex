\chapter{Introduction}

Welcome to the latest attempt by Tom to use the \LaTeX family of tools to try to make system notes.  

In this version, rather than using just my old macros from back in the day I am incorporating the Bridge Winners style file (with very slight modification).  I also have a miniature version of my old macros in bridge-mini.sty that I am including in the project.

I'm using subfiles to try to make section management a bit easier.  I have pre-populated some dummy files for the opening bid section, but there will be more files coming down the road.

My expectation is the "to-do" section will be a list of items that we noted at the table.  As things are added to the notes, we can remove them from the to-do list.  Perhaps not perfect, but it's a reasonable first pass at managing the project on the whole.

\section{Code Snippets}

Throw some text as a test

\flushleft{}\nsauction[Opener,Responder]{1c,1s,1n,2c,2d,?} 
% For reasons I don't understand, auction starts centered.  Flushleft forces it to be left justified, which is likely more desireable.

You can reference bids such as \cl{1} \di{2} \he{3} or \sp{4} inline, or even cards such as \clubs{A} \diamonds{K} \hearts{Q} \spades{J}.
