\section{Stayman Agreements}

\rem{Some of this may be new to you, I don't recall if I've talked about this at all. See \sp3 and 3NT responses as well as \he3 extensions.}

	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{2n,3c,?}}
		\di3 & No 4 card major. 3M rebid over this is Smolen. 4m is natural and forcing. There are no delayed Texas type sequences directly, go through Smolen. \\
		\he3 & 4+ \heartsuit. \sp3 asks about heart length and/or is a heart slam try. Opener bids 3NT with only 4, (over which a new suit is a cuebid slam try for \heartsuit) or bids \he4 or cuebids a minor with 5 \heartsuit. Responder doesn't promise a slam try, they can simply be trying to confirm a 5 card suit. \\
		\sp3 & 4 \spadesuit. \he4 agrees \spadesuit with slam interest, new suits are natural (not cuebids). \\
		3NT & 5 \spadesuit. \he4 agrees \spadesuit, new suits are natural. \\
	\end{bidtable}

\section{Transfer Agreements}

\he3 then \he4 shows 5-5 majors without slam interest.
\di3 then \sp3 shows 5-5 majors with slam interest.

4m rebids are natural and forcing.

Jacoby then 4NT:  Quant
