	\chapter{Defensive Bidding (They Open)}
	
	\section{General Guidelines}
	
	Overcalls can be light and can be 4 cards. The latter happens most often with length in the opening suit and the inability to make a takeout double due to shape (i.e., doubleton in a major). It often has opening strength or close to it.
	
	Takeout doubles can be mildly offshape. Doubletons in unbid minors are common. Doubletons in unbid majors are forbidden except for double-and-bid hands.
	
	Bidding tends to be for lead direction when light.
	
	2 level minor overcalls are often 6, occasionally 5 sound when no other call is reasonable. It is common to double instead of overcalling with \shape(5332).
	
	Direct NT overcalls are sound, (15+)16--18. In the sandwich position we bump this up by a point to a nominal range of (16+)17--19. Tom has made simple 1NT overcalls on bad 19 counts as well.
	
	\section{Strong Club}
	
	Suction at all levels: Every bid is either the next higher (transfer) or the 2 remaining suits (2 lower). Double takes the place of the suit bid in the system; for example, (\cl1)--Dbl is \diamondsuit or (\heartsuit \& \spadesuit). In general, the higher you bid the more distribution you have. 
	
	We will often start with pass with a decent hand. Immediate bids tend to be destructive.
	
	NT bids show ``shape'': (\diamondsuit \& \spadesuit) or (\clubsuit \& \heartsuit).
	
	Responses in general are pass or correct. Raising the suit bid is a ``cuebid'' showing a good hand for the possible combinations and game interest. NT bids turn off the pass/correct signal; they generally ask overcaller to bid clubs over which all bids by advancer are natural, not pass/correct.
	
	If Overcaller bids NT after a pass/correct bid that shows a secondary 4 card suit with 6+ in the ``transfer'' suit. In other words, 1 suited by only kinda-sorta. This is 100\% optional on the part of overcaller.
	
	Suction is on directly over the \cl1 bid as well as any artificial response which does not indicate shape, only values.\footnote{Minor inferences about distribution are allowed. For example, a \he1 bid which shows 8--11 without 5 spades would be considered a suction eligible bid. A \he1 bid which is a transfer to spades would not.}
	
	\section{Polish or Balanced Club}
	
	No special methods, other than double can have any minor suit distribution.
	
	\rem{I think this is correct. I actually like Suction here too, but I seem to recall that you do not. When I do play Suction I play it constructive on the 1 level with double being takeout, not suction.}
	
	\section[Precision 1D]{Precision \di1}
	
	Regardless of promised length, we play \di2 as natural, \he2 as weak (NF) Michaels and \di3 as strong Michaels. 2NT is still \heartsuit \& \clubsuit.
	
	As per balanced \cl1, takeout doubles are random with respect to minor suit distribution.
	
	\section[Transfer response to 1C]{Transfer response to \cl1}
	
	After (\cl1)--Pass--(1Red) xfer we play that double is a normal takeout double (\diamondsuit \& OM) and accepting the transfer is the weird takeout double (\clubsuit \& OM). 2 of the transfer suit is natural, just as the standard (1x)--P--(1M)--2M would be.
	
	\section{1NT}
	
	Over their 1NT opener we play Woolsey:  \cl2 Majors, \di2 Multi, 2M M+min.
	
	Over strong NT, double is a 4 card major, longer minor. Over weak NT it is penalty when possible. (Passed Hand = ?)
	
	\begin{bidtable}{\compauct{1n,2c,p}}
		\di2 & Equal length in majors \\
		2M & NF \\
		2NT & Limit+ raise. \cl3 all min, \di3 equal length non-min, 3M shorter major non-min. \\
		3M & Mixed Raise \\
	\end{bidtable}

	\begin{bidtable}{\compauct{1n,2d,p}}
		2M & Pass or Correct \\
		2NT & Limit+ raise. \cl3 all min, 3Red = xfer. Over \cl3, 3M Pass or Correct \\
		3M & Pass or Correct, Mixed \\
		\cl4 & Please xfer to your suit \\
		\di4 & Please bid your suit \\
		4M & To play, \textit{not} pass or correct \\
	\end{bidtable}

	\begin{bidtable}{\compauct{1n,2M,p}}
		2NT & Asks minor, shows game interest \\
		\clubsuit & Pass or correct for minor any level \\
		\diamondsuit & Good raise of Maj, any level. \di4 sets up a forcing pass. \\
	\end{bidtable}

	Advances over \cl2/\di2 are different if the opps double the bid.
	
	\begin{bidtable}{\compauct{1n,2c,x}}
		Pass & \clubsuit, NF \\
		\di2 & \diamondsuit, NF \\
		XX & Equal length, overcaller to choose \\
		Other & No change \\
	\end{bidtable}

	\begin{bidtable}{\compauct{1n,2d,x}}
		Pass & \diamondsuit, NF \\
		XX & Bid your suit \\
		2M & Natural, not pass or correct \\
		Other & No change, including 3M bids still being Pass or Correct \\
