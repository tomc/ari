	Items that we have identified in play that need to make it into the notes.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To Do
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Mad Scientist Labs}
	
	This is a section for crazy ideas that Tom has.  While this may seem like a low priority item given we are starting the notes from scratch, some of these ideas may have broad implications for the system.  In other words, this is a time to possibly reconstruct the system from the ground up, possibly changing things as we go.
	
	A few examples:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Hand Evaluation - possible reworking our opening bids and responses using something like ZZs or Zar.  This may lead to better asking/showing sequences after shape is known.
		\item Replacing Stayman.  Stayman is Wrong, but a common evil.  I've researched other options and modified some of these ideas into something I like.  Essentially, \cl2\rightarrow\di2.  You lose weak majors, you gain getting out in \di2 and (main benefit) avoid revealing much about the 1NT opener's hand.  One item I haven't fully considered is long minor + 4CM.  Low priority item.
		\item \cl1 responses.  While what we have is fine we might be able to do better, enabling better shape relays that lead into card showing relays.
	\end{itemize}

     \section{Miscellaneous Competitive Auctions}
     \begin{description}
         \item[(\sp1)-X-(\sp2)-X] With some partners, I have played that this double is takeout, and \he3 by doubler promises \he{5}s while 2NT is artificial showing \he{4}s.
