	\chapter[1C]{\cl1}
		
	\section{Description \& Response Summary}
	
	\cl1 is our general forcing opening, showing roughly 17+ HCP balanced or 16+ unbalanced.  The new ACBL convention charts allow for as low as 14 HCP for a forcing bid so long as it meets the rule of 24.  (i.e., 10 cards in 2 suits).  I don't know how much we will take advantage of the new rule, but it is worth noting.
	
	Like all strong club systems, the strength of the system lies not within the \cl1 opening itself but rather allowing for all other openers to be limited.  While we have some special sequences which allow for \"{u}ber max in TaJ sequences, most of our simple 1 level openings are going to be lighter than most people open.  All of our invitational and competitive decisions revolve around that fact.  This can be a factor in deciding between \cl1 and 1M, for example.
		
	\Huge{\color{red}BETA}
		
	New Response Structure
	
	\normalsize
	
	(28 Nov 19) I've advanced these responses to Beta status. We've had some success with them so far, I expect we aren't changing them near term. Having better shape definitions aids for CIRKLE/SQUARE style relays.  Confirmed the Club/Diamond split by PH using \he1.
	
	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{1c,?}}
		\di1 & No change, still negative. \\
		\he1 & (UPH) Extra values w/o hearts \\
		\he1 & (PH) Clubs. \\
		\sp1 & 5+ Hearts unbal.  This is unlimited, unlike the other GF responses.  TaJ has the extra values step. \\
		1NT & 5+ Spades unbal, no extras.  \cl2 TaJ, \sp2 is natural clubs. \\
		\cl2 & (UPH) Clubs or Diamonds.  \di2 asks suit with LH \& zoom into TaJ with \diamondsuit\\
		\cl2 & (PH) Diamonds. \di2 TaJ. \\
		\di2 & 4 \heartsuit without 4 \spadesuit.\\
		\he2 & 4 \spadesuit without 4 \heartsuit. \\
		\sp2 & 44 Majors \\
		2NT & \shape{5332} \clubsuit, R for LMH doubleton.\\ 
		\cl3 & \shape{5332} \diamondsuit, R for LMH doubleton \\
		\di3 & \exactshape{3244}:  Memory aid, low suit is short. \\
		\he3 & \exactshape{2344} \\
		\sp3 & \exactshape{3334} \\
		3NT & \exactshape{3343} \\
	\end{bidtable}

	Over \he1 response, \sp1 relay/waiting with all bids 1NT an higher as per direct.  (This is why \sp1 is unlimited and has the extra values step.)
	
	Over \di2/\he2, relay for shape. Table below is for both. 
	
	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{1c,2d,2h,?}}
		+1 & \shape{5332}, relay for LMH doubleton. \\
		+2 & \shape{4432} with clubs, relay LH for doubleton \\
		+3 & \shape{4432} with diamonds, relay LH for doubleton \\
		+4 & \shape{4333}	\rem{fixed}	\\
		+5 & \shape{4441} (short OM) \\
	\end{bidtable}

	Over \sp2, relay for shape.
	
	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{1c,2s,2n}}
		\cl3 & \exactshape{4432}\\
		\di3 & \exactshape{4423}\\
		\he3 & \exactshape{4441}\\
		\sp3 & \exactshape{4414}\\
	\end{bidtable}

	\rem{Updated!}

	Tying this into CIRKLE:  Once the shape is known, steps below 3NT are CIRKLE in ABCD order. \cl4 is a puppet to \di4, then CIRKLE for any remaining ABCD that could not be bid below 3NT.  \di4 is a puppet to \he4 for sign off anywhere. \di4 to 4NT is a bail to RKC, skipping CIRKLE/SQUARE.
	
	Example
	
	\orauction{1c,2d,2h,2n,3c,3d} 
	
	shows \exactshape{3424}. \he3 and \sp3 are AB CIRKLE.  3NT is sign off, \cl4 puppets for CD CIRKLE. \di4 puppets to sign off anywhere (Not NT, since 3NT was available. Don't ask me what 4NT is.)
	
	Direct jumps to game, such as \he4, would be encouraging but NF.  To sign off strictly go through \di4.
	
	\section[1C--1D]{\cl1--\di1}
	
	\di1 is the general negative bid.  This is the only bid which does not set up a GF auction.
	
	Meckwell style rebids except 2NT is 20--21.
	
	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{1c,1d,?}}
		\he1 & 4+ \heartsuit, can have a longer minor, 1RF.  Unbalanced or semi-balanced. Systemic rebid with 4=4=(4-1)\\
		\sp1 &  4+ \spadesuit, can have a longer minor, 1RF.  Unbalanced or semi-balanced.\\
		1NT & 17--19 bal, can have 5CM or 6Cm.  \shape{5422} also possible.\\
		\cl{2}/\di2 & Nat NF.  Denies 4CM.  Typically 6+ cards and unbalanced.\\
		\he2 & Kokish Relay.  Forces \sp2, Either GF with hearts or GF Bal.\\
		\sp2/\cl3/\di3 & GF Nat, typically 1 suited.\\
		2NT & 20--21 bal\\
		\he3 \& up & Undefined, although game bids are simply to play.		\\
	\end{bidtable}

	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{1c,1d,1h,?}}
		\sp1 & 4+ \spadesuit, any strength.  Typically fewer than 4 \heartsuit.  Most rebids are natural NF, minor suits can be canap\'e. 2NT is an artificial big canap\'e (6+ m) 1RF.  Jumps encouraging but NF with jump shifts being 5--5. \\
		1NT & 0--5, no 4CM.  Rebids as per over \sp1, except \sp2 is a natural reverse and 1RF.\\
		\cl2 & 0--2 \heartsuit, 5+ to 7.  \di2 is waiting and scrambling, \he2 is natural and NF. Other GF.  2NT is a non-canap\'e GF, 3m is canap\'e.\\
		\di2 & Exactly 3 \heartsuit, 5+ to 7. \he2 NF, \he3 Inv.  2NT GF asking for shortness NLMH. Other 1RF, usually canap\'e.\\
		\he2 & 4+ \heartsuit, minimum. New suits are game tries, 2NT asks shortness NLMH.\\
		2NT & Best raise, nearly GF.  5+ \heartsuit ~common, \cl3 asks for shortness NLMH.\\
		JS & 6+ nat, 5+--7\\
		DJS & Splinter with exactly 4\heartsuit		\\
	\end{bidtable}
			

	
	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{1c,1d,1s,?}}
		 & As per over \he1, except \he2 shows 5+ \heartsuit, 5+--7.
	\end{bidtable}
	
	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{1c,1d,1n,?}}
		& 17--19, systems on as per 1NT opening.
	\end{bidtable}

	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{1c,1d,2m,?}}
		& Natural, NF, denies 4CM.  No special follow ups. Jump Shift is a splinter.
	\end{bidtable}

	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{1c,1d,2h,2s,?}}
		& \he2 is Kokish, forces \sp2.  Either \heartsuit ~or bal, GF.  No agreements about bids other than \sp2 by responder. \\
		2NT & GF Balanced.  Systems on as per 2NT opener. \\
		\cl3 & \heartsuit ~\& minor, \di3 for LH. \\
		\di3 & One suited \heartsuit \\
		\he3 & \heartsuit ~\& \spadesuit \\
		Other & ? \rem{Self Spl?} \\
	\end{bidtable}
	
	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{1c,1d,2n,?}}
		& 20--21, as per 2NT opener
	\end{bidtable}

	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{1c,1d,Other}}
		& Other jumps are natural GF.  No special agreements other than \ldots\sp2--2NT is a spade raise, with \sp3 being the more waiting nothing-to-say type bid. Typically bal or near bal, 1--2 \spadesuit.
	\end{bidtable}

	For responses at \di2 or above, opener may skip the relay step to zoom into CIRKLE directly. The known length suit is ``A'' for this purpose, other suits are BCD in game order.  (For \sp2, \heartsuit is A and \spadesuit is B, per normal rules.)
