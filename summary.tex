No special agreements for opening bids 4NT and higher.

\section{General Principles}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Doubles unless otherwise defined are takeout
	\item All Strange Bids are Forcing (ASBAF).  A general guideline to cover the unknown.
	\item In an auction where we've committed to a certain level and the opps interfere (including double), pass is generally more encouraging than bidding to the forced the level.  A common example is a cuebid (raise) being doubled, then rebidding our trump suit.
	\item We ignore most doubles by the opponent, bidding retains their meaning.  This does not apply to 1-level suit opening bids.
	\item Minimum responses to opening bids: while we pass \di1 freely up to 9 HCP, we follow more standard approaches to responding to 1M: respond with an Ace, a King and a 5 count or any 6 count.  Responding to 2m is a little different, passing is quite possible with 8 or so points, especially with no fit.  Even 10 or 11 counts are possible over \di2.
